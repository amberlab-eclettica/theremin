# Arduino Light Theremin

A DIY **photoresistor-based theremin** built with an Arduino Nano and a piezo buzzer.  
Move your hand over the LDR to change the pitch â€” just like a classic theremin, but with light!
Heavily inspired from the classic [Arduino example](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/SBR/light-theremin-1d63fe).

## Features

- Real-time pitch control using a photoresistor
- Automatic calibration on startup (adapts to ambient light)
- Exponential smoothing to reduce noise and jitter
- Linear pitch mapping (100 Hz â€“ 1500 Hz)
- Plays a short melody on startup/shutdown ðŸŽµ

## Hardware Required

- Arduino Nano (or compatible board)
- 1x Photoresistor
- 1x 10kÎ© resistor (for voltage divider)
- 1x Piezo buzzer
- Jumper wires

---

## Circuit Connections

- **Buzzer** â†’ Digital pin D2  
- **Photoresistor + 10kÎ© resistor** â†’ Voltage divider into Analog pin A0  
- **LED (optional)** â†’ Built-in LED on pin 13 (used during calibration)

## Installation & Usage

1. Install [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/) or Arduino IDE.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amberlab-eclettica/theremin.git
   cd theremin
```
3. Compile and upload your repository to the arduino:
   ```bash
   make
   make upload
```
4. Cover/uncover the photoresistor with your hand to play the theremin.
